# **Signals Project**
## First: Data description 

The [Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/oculusgraphy-pediatric-and-adults-electroretinograms-database) was gathered from both adults and pediatric individuals.
Total of 425 patients were tested according to different protocols:

| Protocol | N. Adults | N. pediatrics |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Scotopic 2.0 ERG Response` | 23 | 51 |
| `Maximum 2.0 ERG Response` | 42 | 80 |
| `Photopic 2.0 ERG Response` | 32 | 74 |
| `Photopic 2.0 EGR Flicker Response` | 38 | 63 | 
|`Scotopic 2.0 ERG Oscillatory Potentials`| 13 | 7 |

**The data consists of :**
- The patientâ€™s age
- The Diagnosis 
- The graph representing the response 
- The potential difference after each half millisecond

Working on this project, only Scotopic, Maximum & Photobic 2.0 ERG Response where taken into consideration.
You'll find the data uploaded to the repository at [01 Appendix 1](https://github.com/FGamil/Signals_Project/blob/main/01%20Appendix%201.xlsx).

## Second: Data preprocessing
### Dropping and redefining data
The data we previously referred to weren't appropriately organized to be processed. Therfor, we organized them in a dataframe where we only added the data needed in processing and neglected the rest.

```
#Example using Scotobic 2.0 Response
SR = pd.read_excel("/kaggle/input/electroretinogram/01 Appendix 1.xlsx", sheet_name='Scotopic 2.0 ERG Response')
SR.drop(columns = SR.columns[80:], inplace=True) #Here we removed all the cells that have no value

```
After dropping the empty cells, we redefined the diagnosis classes into **normal** and **abnormal** to make it easier to understand and more efficiently classified. 

```
mapping = {'The functional activity of the central and peripheral parts of the retina in both eyes is preserved.':'abnormal','Pupil is narrow.':'abnormal','The functional activity of the central and peripheral parts of the retina in both eyes is preserved.':'abnormal','Registration of ERG with a narrow pupil.':'abnormal','Registration of the ERG of a narrow pupil from the skin of the eyelid.':'abnormal','ERG pupil is narrow.':'abnormal','Registration of ERG from the skin of the eyelid, the pupil is narrow.':'abnormal','Registration of ERG with a narrow pupil from the skin of the eyelid.':'abnormal','The functional activity of the central and peripheral parts of the retina in both eyes is preserved.':'abnormal','High level of interference due to increased physical activity of the child.':'abnormal','The functional activity of the retina is preserved.':'normal','The functional activity of the retina at the OU is preserved.': 'normal','The functional activity of the retina is preserved.':'normal','No negative dynamics compared to previous data.': 'normal','The functional activity of the retina is preserved.': 'normal','The functional activity of the central and peripheral parts of the retina in both eyes is preserved.':'normal','No diagnosis.': 'normal','The signal is within normal limits.': 'normal','The functional activity of the retina is preserved, corresponds to the age norm symmetrically on the OU.': 'normal','The functional activity of the retina in both eyes is preserved.': 'normal','The amplitude-time characteristics of the EP in a homogeneous field correspond to the norm.': 'normal','The functional activity of the retina in both eyes is preserved.

MR.replace(mapping, inplace=True)
PR.replace(mapping, inplace=True)
SR.replace(mapping, inplace=True)
```
Now we got the ,for instance, Scotopic 2.0 Response data looking like that:

</div>
### Assembling a new dataframe

So, now to assemble a dataframe that contains the data needed for processing, which are only the diagnosis, patient ID and signal type, we use the coming code:

```
patiant_Diagnosis_M = MR.iloc[4 , :107].tolist()
patiant_Diagnosis_P = PR.iloc[4 , :95].tolist()
patiant_Diagnosis_S = SR.iloc[4 , :73].tolist()

patiant_id_M = MR.iloc[3 , :107].tolist()
patiant_id_P = PR.iloc[3 , :95].tolist() 
patiant_id_S = SR.iloc[3 , :73].tolist()

M_R =['MR']*107
P_R =['PR']*95
S_R =['SR']*73

# Create a dictionary from the two lists
dict = {'Patient_id': patiant_id_M+patiant_id_P+patiant_id_S, 'Label': patiant_Diagnosis_M+patiant_Diagnosis_P+patiant_Diagnosis_S ,'signal_type':M_R+P_R+S_R}

# Create a new dataframe from the dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(dict)
```
After running this code, we get a dataframe that consists of the data of **299** patients from which **109** are abnormal and **190** are normal. 
Then, we define to new directories named "signals" and "augmented_images" to save the images we're going to get out of the signals we have. 

```
!mkdir signals
!mkdir augmented_images
```
### Wavelet transformation 

To be able to work with the signals we gathered, first we needed to transform them into a both time and frequency representation through ***Ricker wavelet transform (Mexican hat)***.
> The output of applying this wavelet transform are gray-scale scalogram images.
```
#Example on SR signal transformation 
signal_SR=[]
signal_SR_id=[]
for j in range(0,2):
    for i in range (1,74):
        signal = np.array(SR.iloc[21: ,i].tolist())  
        signal_values = signal[np.logical_not(np.isnan(signal))]
        k = repeat_val(len(signal_values))

        signal_values = np.tile(signal_values.tolist()+[0]*0,k-j)
          
        coefficients, frequencies = pywt.cwt(signal_values, scales=np.arange(1, 128), wavelet='mexh')
        plt.figure(figsize=(5.12, 5.12))
        plt.imshow(abs(coefficients) ** 2, cmap='gray', aspect='auto',vmax=abs(coefficients).max(), vmin=-abs(coefficients).min())
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.savefig(os.path.join(path, f'SR_{i}_{j}_f.png'))
        plt.close()
        signal_SR.append(path + f'SR_{i}_{j}_f.png')
        signal_SR_id.append(f'SR_{i}_{j}_f')

```
Note that in order to expand the available data we used the function **repeat_val**
```
def repeat_val(x):
    if x<200 : k=4 
    elif x>200 and x<=400 : k=3 
    elif x>400 and x<=550 : k=2 
    return k
```
to get the signal size and calculate the number of times we're going to repeat each signal through the function **np.tile()**.
Since the data were repeated, we needed to change the labels to deffrentiate between the original and the replicate data.

```
df = pd.DataFrame({'Label': np.tile(df['Label'],2)})
#The resulting data are then grouped in 2 lists
df['img_Path'] = signal_MR+signal_PR+signal_SR
df['img_id'] = signal_MR_id+signal_PR_id+signal_SR_id 
```
These previous codes resulted in increasing the data to be **380** normal and **218** abnormal signal images.
The lists are then converted into a **.CSV** file to be able to use it to train the model before data augmentation to compare between the results. The diagnosis are then mapped into 0s and 1s.
```
df.to_csv('data1.csv')
mapping = {'normal': int(0), 'abnormal': int(1)}  
df.replace(mapping, inplace=True)
df = df.reset_index(drop=True)
```

### Balancing the data 

since the normal and abnormal values are imbalanced, we remove a random 150 image of those labeled to be normal. Following this, the resulting datafrawe is saved into a **.csv** file.
```
dropped_normal = df.query('Label == 0').sample(n=150)
df.drop(droped_normal.index, inplace=True)
df=df.reset_index(drop=True)
df.to_csv('Scalogram_grayscale_images.csv')
```

### Data Augmentation 
To every signal image, 5 augmented images are produced. The changes applied to the images are due to rotation, shearing, zooming, horizontal flipping, and changing brightness.
```
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    brightness_range=(0.8, 1.2)
)
```
Afterwards, the output images were saved into the augmented_image directory created before. 
```
for n in range (len(df.img_Path)):
    # Loading a sample image 
    img = load_img(df.img_Path[n]) 
    # Converting the input sample image to an array
    x = img_to_array(img)
    # Reshaping the input image
    x = x.reshape((1, ) + x.shape)
    j=0
    # Loop through the 5 augmented images and save each image with its corresponding label
    for i, batch in enumerate(datagen.flow(x, batch_size=1,save_format='png')):
        # Get the augmented image array
        augmented_image = batch[0]
        # Get the corresponding label
        label = labels[j]
        j+=1
        # Save the augmented image with its corresponding label
        img = array_to_img(augmented_image)
        img.save(os.path.join(augmented_folder_path, f'{df.img_id[n]}_{label}.png'))
        paths_aug.append(f'{augmented_folder_path}/{df.img_id[n]}_{label}.png')  
        lables_aug.append(df.Label[n])
        id_aug.append(f'{df.img_id[n]}_{label}')
        if j==5:
            break  
```
Then, the final dataframe is created and converted into a **.csv** file and later on all of the output files created before are zipped and [downloaded](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-Yg5qg3a5YJ2_lyF2-BKrJC_rgpHINid&usp=drive_fs).

```
dict = {'img_Path': paths_aug+list(df.img_Path), 'Label': lables_aug+list(df.Label), 'img_id': id_aug+list(df.img_id) }
final = pd.DataFrame(dict)

final.to_csv('Scalogram_grayscale_augumented_images.csv')

shutil.make_archive('/kaggle/working/output', 'zip', '/kaggle/working/')
```
