## First: Data description 

The [Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/oculusgraphy-pediatric-and-adults-electroretinograms-database) was gathered from both adults and pediatric individuals.
Total of 425 patients were tested according to different protocols:

| Protocol | N. Adults | N. pediatrics |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Scotopic 2.0 ERG Response` | 23 | 51 |
| `Maximum 2.0 ERG Response` | 42 | 80 |
| `Photopic 2.0 ERG Response` | 32 | 74 |
| `Photopic 2.0 EGR Flicker Response` | 38 | 63 | 
|`Scotopic 2.0 ERG Oscillatory Potentials`| 13 | 9 |

**The data consists of :**
- The patientâ€™s age
- The Diagnosis 
- The graph representing the response 
- The potential difference after each half second

You'll find the data uploaded to the repository at [01 Appendix 1](https://github.com/FGamil/Signals_Project/blob/main/01%20Appendix%201.xlsx).
