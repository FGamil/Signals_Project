# **Signals Project**
## First: Data description 

The [Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/oculusgraphy-pediatric-and-adults-electroretinograms-database) was gathered from both adults and pediatric individuals.
Total of 425 patients were tested according to different protocols:

| Protocol | N. Adults | N. pediatrics |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Scotopic 2.0 ERG Response` | 23 | 51 |
| `Maximum 2.0 ERG Response` | 42 | 80 |
| `Photopic 2.0 ERG Response` | 32 | 74 |
| `Photopic 2.0 EGR Flicker Response` | 38 | 63 | 
|`Scotopic 2.0 ERG Oscillatory Potentials`| 13 | 7 |

**The data consists of :**
- The patientâ€™s age
- The Diagnosis 
- The graph representing the response 
- The potential difference after each half second

Working on this project, only Scotopic, Maximum & Photobic 2.0 ERG Response where taken into consideration.
You'll find the data uploaded to the repository at [01 Appendix 1](https://github.com/FGamil/Signals_Project/blob/main/01%20Appendix%201.xlsx).

## Second: Data preprocessing
### Dropping 
The data we previously referred to weren't appropriately organized to be processed. Therfor, we organized them in a dataframe where we only added the data needed in processing and neglected the rest.

```
#Example using Scotobic 2.0 Response
SR = pd.read_excel("/kaggle/input/electroretinogram/01 Appendix 1.xlsx", sheet_name='Scotopic 2.0 ERG Response')
SR.drop(columns = SR.columns[80:], inplace=True) #Here we removed all the cells that have no value

```
After dropping the empty cells, we redefined the diagnosis classes into **normal** and **abnormal** to make it easier to understand and more efficiently classified. 

```

PR.replace(mapping, inplace=True)
SR.replace(mapping, inplace=True)

Now we got the ,for instance, Scotopic 2.0 Response data looking like that:
<div>
<img src="https://github.com/FGamil/Signals_Project/blob/main/SR.PNG"width=500 heigth=500>   
</div>
So, now to assemble a dataframe that contains the data needed for processing, which are only the diagnosis, patient ID and signal type, we use the coming code:

```
patiant_Diagnosis_M = MR.iloc[4 , :107].tolist()
patiant_Diagnosis_P = PR.iloc[4 , :95].tolist()
patiant_Diagnosis_S = SR.iloc[4 , :73].tolist()

patiant_id_M = MR.iloc[3 , :107].tolist()
patiant_id_P = PR.iloc[3 , :95].tolist() 
patiant_id_S = SR.iloc[3 , :73].tolist()

M_R =['MR']*107
P_R =['PR']*95
S_R =['SR']*73

# Create a dictionary from the two lists
dict = {'Patient_id': patiant_id_M+patiant_id_P+patiant_id_S, 'Label': patiant_Diagnosis_M+patiant_Diagnosis_P+patiant_Diagnosis_S ,'signal_type':M_R+P_R+S_R}

# Create a new dataframe from the dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(dict)
```
